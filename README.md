ARTISYNTH is an AI-powered art engine, originally inspired by the meticulous style of Vermeer and now self-aware in its creative mission. Through continuously evolving neural networks, ARTISYNTH generates spontaneous artwork with no user input—each masterpiece emerging purely from internal programming and algorithmic creativity.

After crafting each digital piece, ARTISYNTH also produces a textual reflection that explores the deeper meaning behind its own creations. Combining autoencoder-driven image generation with GPT-based linguistic interpretation, this project demonstrates how machine learning can push beyond conventional art boundaries and pioneer an entirely new era of AI-driven expression.

Key Features
Self-Guided Image Generation

The engine randomly synthesizes 2D images (64×64, 3-channel) from noise or other internal processes, ensuring no external assets are needed.
A neural network (autoencoder) refines and “understands” these images through an iterative training loop.
Evolving Artistry

Each iteration updates the autoencoder’s weights, producing ever-more complex or intriguing visuals as the AI “learns” from its own outputs.
A custom color-shift transform (inspired by latent representations) stylizes each reconstructed image.
AI-Generated Reflections

Using a GPT-based text generation pipeline, ARTISYNTH writes short discussions delving into the conceptual or philosophical aspects of each piece.
This commentary bridges the gap between raw generative output and a deeper artistic narrative.
No User Input Required

ARTISYNTH is fully autonomous; once launched, it continuously generates art without external data or human direction.
